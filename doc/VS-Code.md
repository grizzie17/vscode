# Visual Studio Code #

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a totally opensource project that is sponsored by Microsoft.

Either built-in or via "extensions" vscode includes (as a minor subset):

* tabbed editors
* split window editors
* preview windows for files such as: html, php, markdown, svg, LaTeX, JSON
* multiple-cursors and block selection
* slick code refactoring
* themes
* keybindings for vi, emacs, sublime, atom, visual-studio, notepad++, eclipse, jetbrains, netbeans and a bunch more...
* code highlighters (so many different languages its hard to enumerate and growing daily)
* source code browsers (both locally and remote via a plethora of protocols)
* file differences (which includes diffs with saved versions, clipboard, selection, etc)
* symbolic outline modes
* github/gitlab workflow integration
* github/gitlab issue/pull-request browser
* github/gitlab "blame" integrated into the editor
* integrated Source Code Managers including: git, svn, rcs, Hg, Visual Studio Team Services, ...
* integrated consoles
* debugger extensions for both local and remote
* developer collaboration
* and so many others, I haven't discovered them all.

## Getting Started ##

To get started visit the [download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) page and select the appropriate install (for our use, it should be Windows10).  When you are installing, it is very handy if you enable the "Context" menu which will add an "Open with Code" item to your right-mouse menu while in file explorer.

Then you may want to visit the [Documents](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) page and watch a handful of the introductory videos.
